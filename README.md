# Secrets Hunter

**Secrets Hunter** is a lightweight, fully autonomous, and dependency-free scanner that detects secrets across filesystems, git history, and exposed domain paths.

It is language agnostic and works on text content rather than language-specific syntax, which makes it suitable for finding secrets in mixed repositories, configuration files, scripts, and infrastructure code.

> Secrets Hunter is intended for defensive security work. Do not use it to scan third-party systems, domains, repositories, or infrastructure without permission.

Scans do not require external dependencies to run, though git must be installed to scan git history. You can run scans from the command line, wire them into git hooks for local development, or automate them in CI to act as a security gate.

## How It Works

Secrets are detected using a combined **regex** and **entropy** approach, though the list of built-in regex patterns is intentionally kept short for three reasons:

- The number of existing secret formats is huge.
- Secret formats often overlap, so the provider cannot always be identified reliably.
- Most generated secrets are high-entropy strings anyway.

There are a few exceptions to this, such as PEM keys, database connection strings, secrets with unusual character sets, or low-entropy secrets. This is where regex patterns come in handy.

Instead, for generic secrets, Secrets Hunter gives a **confidence boost** to high-entropy strings when assignment or key/value context identifies the value as a secret through names like `API_KEY`, `secret_token`, etc.

Consider this line:

```text
github_token = "github_pat_9VRaty87LsNBXRzccREkHNN8bqRLDAZ67Yo3X0pbTqJFoFMBAzgu8RvaoSXg"
```

The value is a high-entropy string. It is assigned to a variable named `github_token`, which identifies the value as a token. In that context, Secrets Hunter can treat it as a **high-confidence** secret.

In contrast, this line:

```text
hash = "50d858e0985ecc7f60418aaf0cc5ab587f42c2570a884095a9e8ccac50fe0159"
```

also contains an assignment and a high-entropy value, but the variable name `hash` identifies it as non-secret context. Secrets Hunter treats it as a **false positive** rather than an actionable secret.

For a deeper explanation of how regex patterns, entropy checks, assignment context, confidence levels, and scan modes work together, see the [Scan Modes](https://docs.fvlcn.dev/secrets-hunter/scan-modes/) and [Detection Process](https://docs.fvlcn.dev/secrets-hunter/detection-process/) docs.

## Installation

> Requires Python 3.11 or newer.

Secrets Hunter can be installed via PyPI, from source, or using Docker. For a quick start, install directly from PyPI:

```bash
pip install secrets-hunter
```

For installation from source or Docker, see the [Installation docs](https://docs.fvlcn.dev/secrets-hunter/installation/).

## Quick Start

Use `secrets-hunter` with a local target for filesystem scans, `--git-revset` for git history, or `--domain` for exposed domain paths.

Scan the current directory:

```bash
secrets-hunter .
```

Scan a specific file:

```bash
secrets-hunter path/to/file.py
```

Scan git history using a git revision expression:

```bash
secrets-hunter . --git-revset main..HEAD
```

Scan commonly exposed domain paths:

```bash
secrets-hunter --domain example.com
```

Findings are masked by default. To reveal them, use `--reveal-findings`:

```bash
secrets-hunter . --reveal-findings
```

Export results to JSON or SARIF:

```bash
secrets-hunter . --json results.json
secrets-hunter . --sarif results.sarif
```

Fail with exit code `2` when actionable findings are present:

```bash
secrets-hunter . --min-confidence 75 --fail-on-findings
```

See the [Usage docs](https://docs.fvlcn.dev/secrets-hunter/usage/) for all flags and more examples.

## Configuration

Secrets Hunter ships with built-in packaged defaults. You can display them using the CLI:

```bash
secrets-hunter showconfig
```

The detection behavior described above is configurable. Secret patterns, secret keywords, false-positive rules, and ignore rules can be adjusted with TOML configuration overlays.

Example team baseline overlay:

```bash
secrets-hunter . --config team.toml
```

Multiple overlays are applied **in the order provided**:

```bash
secrets-hunter . --config ci.toml --config local.toml
```

A full description and usage examples are available in [Configuration docs](https://docs.fvlcn.dev/secrets-hunter/config/).
